# Zcity-pizzeria

# Owerview

After a long deferment, the mayor of Z-city has allowed pizzerias to be opened in town. Pizzerias used to be unlawful because of health reasons (according to the mayor). The city is big, and suddenly there are pizzerias everywhere.
We can imagine the city like a matrix with NxN squares, where every square represents one block of the city. Every pizzeria only delivers pizza to the nearby blocks. Specifically, every pizzeria delivers pizza to every block that is at most K blocks away from the pizzeria's block. Distance is determined by the minimum number of blocks that the delivery guy must take if he is going East/West or North/South (moving diagonally is forbidden in Z-city). For example, let's say that N=5 and a pizzeria is located at the block (3, 3). It can deliver to a 2 block distance at most. The following map shows where the given pizzeria delivers pizzas.
